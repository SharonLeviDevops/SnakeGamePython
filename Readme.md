# Python Snake Game

This is a classic snake game built with Python using the Pygame library. The game is inspired by the popular Nokia mobile game, Snake Xenzia.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as many food pellets as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail. The game is over if the snake hits the wall or its own tail.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
